            "[01:44] John Moult - CASP, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem.\n",
            "[01:50] John Moult - When we started CASP in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be.\n",

            "[02:01] ? - Let's see what, what, what are we doing still to improve?\n",
            "[02:03] ? - Typically 100 different groups from around the world participate in CASP, and we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like.\n",
            "[02:15] ? - We can reach 57.9 GDT on CASP 12 ground truth.\n",

            "[03:06] John Moult - For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence.\n",
            "[03:11] ? - We've advanced the state of the art in the field, so that's fantastic, but we still got a long way to go before we've solved it.\n",
            "[03:18] ? - The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details, exactly where each atom sits, which is really what we would call a solution, we're not yet there.\n",
            "[03:29] ? - It doesn't help if you have the tallest ladder when you're going to the moon.\n",
            "[03:33] ? - We hit a little bit of a brick wall, um, since we won CASP, then it was back to the drawing board and like what are our new ideas?\n",
            "[03:41] ? - Um, and then it's taken a little while, I would say, for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas.\n",
            "[03:51] ? - They can go further, right?\n",
            "[03:52] ? - So, um, so that's a really important moment.\n",
            "[03:55] ? - I've seen that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now, and I know this is the time now to press.\n",
            "[04:02] ? - We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here.\n",
            "[04:05] ? - I think we've got no time to lose.\n",
            "[04:07] ? - So the intention is to enter CASP again.\n",
            "[04:09] ? - CASP is deeply stressful.\n",
            "[04:12] ? - There's something weird going on with, um, the learning because it is learning something that's correlated with GDT, but it's not calibrated.\n",
            "[04:18] ? - I feel slightly uncomfortable.\n",
            "[04:20] ? - We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye.\n",
            "[04:23] ? - The technology advancing outside DeepMind is also doing incredible work.\n",
            "[04:27] Richard Evans - And there's always the possibility another team has come somewhere out there field that we don't even know about.\n",
            "[04:32] ? - Someone asked me, well, should we panic now?\n",
            "[04:33] ? - Of course, we should have been panicking before.\n",
            "[04:35] ? - It does seem to do better, but still doesn't do quite as well as the best model.\n",
            "[04:39] ? - Um, so it looks like there's room for improvement.\n",
            "[04:42] ? - There's always a risk that you've missed something, and that's why blind assessments like CASP are so important to validate whether our results are real.\n",
            "[04:49] ? - Obviously, I'm excited to see how CASP 14 goes.\n",
            "[04:51] ? - My expectation is we get our heads down, we focus on the full goal, which is to solve the whole problem.\n",
            "[05:14] ? - We were prepared for CASP to start on April 15th because that's when it was originally scheduled to start, and it's been delayed by a month due to coronavirus.\n",
            "[05:24] ? - I really miss everyone.\n",
            "[05:25] ? - No, I struggled a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially, uh, my wife, she came down with the, the virus.\n",
            "[05:32] ? - I mean, luckily it didn't turn out too serious.\n",
            "[05:34] ? - CASP started on Monday.\n",
            "[05:37] Demis Hassabis - Can I just check this diagram you've got here, John, this one where we ask ground truth.\n",
            "[05:40] Demis Hassabis - Is this one we've done badly on?\n",
            "[05:42] ? - We're actually quite good on this region.\n",
            "[05:43] ? - If you imagine that we hadn't have said it came around this way, but had put it in.\n",
            "[05:47] ? - Yeah, and that instead.\n",
            "[05:48] ? - Yeah.\n",
            "[05:49] ? - One of the hardest proteins we've gotten in CASP thus far is a SARS-CoV-2 protein, uh, called Orf8.\n",
            "[05:55] ? - Orf8 is a coronavirus protein.\n",
            "[05:57] ? - We tried really hard to improve our prediction, like really, really hard, probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target.\n",
            "[06:05] ? - So we're about two-thirds of the way through CASP, and we've gotten three answers back.\n",
            "[06:11] ? - We now have a ground truth for Orf8, which is one of the coronavirus proteins.\n",
            "[06:17] ? - And it turns out we did really well in predicting that.\n",
            "[06:20] Demis Hassabis - Amazing job, everyone, the whole team.\n",
            "[06:23] Demis Hassabis - It's been an incredible effort.\n",
            "[06:24] John Moult - Here what we saw in CASP 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat, essentially solving what in our world is two problems.\n",
            "[06:34] John Moult - How do you look to find the right solution, and then how do you recognize you've got the right solution when you're there?\n",
            "[06:41] ? - All right, are we, are we mostly here?\n",
            "[06:46] ? - I'm going to read an email.\n",
            "[06:48] ? - Uh, I got this from John Moult.\n",
            "[06:50] ? - Now I'll just read it.\n",
            "[06:51] ? - It says, John, as I expect you know, your group has performed amazingly well in CASP 14, both relative to other groups and in absolute model accuracy.\n",
            "[07:02] ? - Congratulations on this work.\n",
            "[07:05] ? - It is really outstanding.\n",

            "[07:13] John Moult - It's pretty mind-blowing.\n",
            "[07:16] John Moult - You know, these results were, for me, having worked on this problem so long, after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there, suddenly this is a solution.\n",

            "text/markdown": "## Terminology Used for Video Transcriptions\n\nHere's a breakdown of common terminology used when discussing video transcriptions:\n\n*   **Transcription:** The general process of converting audio or video content into text.\n*   **Video Transcription:** Specifically refers to transcribing the audio portion of a video.\n*   **Verbatim Transcription:** A transcription that includes every spoken word, including filler words (\"um,\" \"ah\"), false starts, stutters, and background noises (if relevant).  It aims for a highly accurate and complete record.\n*   **Clean Verbatim Transcription (or Edited Transcription):** A transcription that removes filler words, false starts, and stutters to create a more readable and polished text.  It focuses on conveying the core message clearly.\n*   **Intelligent Verbatim Transcription:** Similar to clean verbatim, but may also correct minor grammatical errors or rephrase sentences slightly for clarity, while still preserving the speaker's intent and style.\n*   **Timecoding (or Timestamping):** Adding timestamps to the transcription to indicate when specific words or phrases were spoken in the video.  This is crucial for navigation and referencing specific moments.\n*   **Speaker Identification:** Identifying and labeling different speakers in the transcription (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2, or using names if known).\n*   **Captioning:** Creating text versions of the audio content that are synchronized with the video for accessibility.  Captions are typically displayed on the screen.\n*   **Subtitles:** Similar to captions, but often used for translating the audio into a different language.\n*   **SRT (SubRip Subtitle) file:** A common file format for subtitles and captions, containing the text and timing information.\n*   **VTT (Video Text Tracks) file:** A more advanced file format for subtitles and captions, offering more styling options and metadata.\n*   **Burned-in Captions (or Open Captions):** Captions that are permanently embedded in the video and cannot be turned off.\n*   **Closed Captions:** Captions that can be turned on or off by the viewer.\n*   **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** The technology used to automatically transcribe audio or video.  ASR systems are constantly improving but often require human review and editing for accuracy.\n*   **Human Transcription:** Transcription performed by a human transcriber, which generally results in higher accuracy than ASR alone.\n\n## Typical Output Example\n\nHere's an example of a **clean verbatim transcription** with **timecoding** and **speaker identification**:\n\n**Video:** A short interview with a software engineer.\n\n```\n00:00:00 - Interviewer: Welcome, Sarah, thanks for joining us today.\n\n00:00:03 - Sarah: Thanks for having me!\n\n00:00:05 - Interviewer: So, tell us a little bit about your role as a software engineer.\n\n00:00:10 - Sarah: Sure.  I work on the front-end development team.  We're responsible for building the user interface for our web application.  So, basically, what the users see and interact with.\n\n00:00:20 - Interviewer: And what are some of the challenges you face in that role?\n\n00:00:24 - Sarah: Well, keeping up with the latest technologies is always a challenge.  The web development landscape is constantly evolving, so we need to be constantly learning and adapting.  Also, ensuring a consistent user experience across different browsers and devices can be tricky.\n\n00:00:38 - Interviewer: That makes sense. What do you enjoy most about your job?\n\n00:00:42 - Sarah: I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect.  Taking a complex problem and breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces, and then finding creative solutions.  And, of course, seeing users actually benefit from the features we build.\n\n00:00:54 - Interviewer: That's great. Any advice for aspiring software engineers?\n\n00:00:58 - Sarah: Definitely focus on building a strong foundation in fundamental concepts.  And don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.  The best way to learn is by doing.\n\n00:01:07 - Interviewer: Excellent advice. Thanks again for your time, Sarah.\n\n00:01:10 - Sarah: You're welcome!\n```\n\n**Key features of this example:**\n\n*   **Speaker Identification:**  Clearly identifies who is speaking (Interviewer and Sarah).\n*   **Timecoding:**  Timestamps (e.g., `00:00:00`) indicate the start time of each utterance.\n*   **Clean Verbatim:**  Filler words like \"um\" and \"uh\" have been removed for readability.  Minor pauses are also omitted.\n*   **Clear and Concise:**  The transcription is easy to read and understand.\n\nThis is just one example, and the specific format and level of detail will vary depending on the requirements of the project.  A verbatim transcription would include all the \"ums\" and \"ahs,\" while a more heavily edited transcription might rephrase sentences for even greater clarity."

Researchers sometimes refer to \"attention dilution\" for long-context, million-token-scale benchmarks.

        "- The current prompt is not perfect and can be improved. It has been preserved in its current state to illustrate its development starting with Gemini 2.0 Flash and a simple video test suite.\n",
        "- The Gemini 2.5 models are more capable and intrinsically provide a better video understanding. However, the current prompt has not been optimized for them. Writing optimal prompts for different models is another challenge.\n",
        "- If you test transcribing your own videos, especially different types of videos, you may run into new or specific issues. They can probably be addressed by enriching the prompt.\n",
        "- Future models will likely support more output features. This should allow for richer structured outputs and for simpler prompts.\n",
        "- As models keep learning, it's also possible that multimodal video transcription will become a one-liner prompt.\n",
        "- Gemini's image and audio tokenizers are truly impressive and enable many other use cases. To fully grasp the extent of the possibilities, you can run unit tests on images or audio files.\n",
        "- We constrained our challenge to using a single request, which can dilute the LLM's attention in such rich multimodal contexts. For optimal results in a large-scale solution, splitting the processing into two steps (i.e., requests) should help Gemini's attention focus even further. In the first step, we'd extract and diarize the audio stream only, which should result in the most precise speech-to-text transcription (maybe with more voice identifiers than actual speakers, but with a minimal number of false positives). In the second step, we'd reinject the transcription to focus on extracting and consolidating speaker data from the video frames. This would also be a solution to process very long videos, even those several hours in duration.\n"
